					<p class="post-meta"> by <a href="../../../../author/j-f-hotte/index.html" title="Posts by J.F. Hotte" rel="author">J.F. Hotte</a> | Aug 11, 2014 | <a href="../../index.html" rel="category tag">Bitcoin 2.0 &amp; Metacoins</a>, <a href="../../../headlines/index.html" rel="category tag">Headlines</a> | </p><p>Dear alt coin traders,</p>
<p>It seems like you still keep your alt coins on exchanges! We all remember what happened to Mt. Gox and now BTER with NXT.. hasn’t that taught us a lesson? After all, investors and traders are still willing to take risks. What we need to do is to convince all traders to withdraw their crypto-currencies from exchanges and store them in a safer places like: encrypted wallets, paper wallets, COLD wallets.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Here are some good easy ways to protect your coins</strong></p>
<div class='one_third'>
					<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-738" src="http://cryptomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/encrypt-wallet.png" alt="encrypt-wallet" width="239" height="162" /></p>
<p><strong>Run your own wallet client</strong> (usually QT) and encrypt it!! For short term safety, putting a wallet on a device where you control the keys is a safe bet. For longer and safer storage, you can configure your wallets on a USB stick and save a copy in your safe deposit box. And always backup your wallet.dat but be weary of using cloud storage.
				</div>
<div class='one_third'>
					<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-755" src="http://cryptomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/passbox.png" alt="passbox" width="240" height="163" /></p>
<p><strong>Paper wallet generators</strong> are an easy way to create a secure storage system for your coins. However, paper may not be durable enough for long term storage. You can configure key pair records in your favorite password management system. Password Box also gives you the ability to share your passwords so you can give access to your legacy manager or your lawyer so your crypto-currency holdings are not forgotten or lost in case you pass away.
				</div>

<p>This last bit of advice may be the best way to keep crypto-currency in a completely invisible way. You can create a mnemonic Bitcoin wallet from a phrase or a list of words. It&#8217;s called a <strong>brain wallet</strong> and most wallet generators have this option. But be careful, if you use a simple password or an obvious phrase that has been published before, you will lose your coins within 24 hours!

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand it&#8217;s so much easier to trade by keeping your altcoins on exchanges. When you see an opportunity, all you need to do is click on a few buttons and you are ready to buy a new coin. Unfortunately, exchanges are not a safe enough yet to store coins long term. July 14th, there was a successful attack on Mintpal exchange. 30% of Vericoin were stolen because Mintpal did not store VRC in cold wallets (approximately USD$2,000,000 worth of coins).</p>
<p>Hopefully, these attacks will serve as wakeup call. Attacks like these provide a big incentive to the exchanges to improve their security. Even though this situation seems “awkward”, hackers are good for the crypto world. I believe the only way altcoins and bitcoin will really go mainstream is with the participation of exchanges security. The day people will feel &#8220;safe&#8221; keeping money in crypto exchanges, will be the day mainstream will adopt it, just like they do leaving fortunes in bank account accessible by internet solutions.</p>
<p>When people tell me about the Mt. Gox story, and that they are not investing in Bitcoin because it&#8217;s not safe, I simply tell them that they are doing the same thing, right now, with the banking system. Banking websites are being hacked as you read these words. The Associated Press reported in July that the bank account of a California escrow firm, Efficient Services Escrow Group, was hacked in December 2012 and January 2013, with three payments totaling $1.5 million wired to accounts in China and Russia. Only $432,215 was recovered, and the company shut down.Online banking frauds are rising year after year. Dailymail.co.uk reported that in 2012 banks intern frauds increased by 28% in UK. Billions of dollars are stolen in fraud hacks, phishing sites every year since banks started using internet solutions. The French bank Societe Generale lost £3.7 billion in one of the biggest corporate banking frauds of all time. In 2002 John Rusnak, a currency trader at US bank Allfirst, based in Baltimore, Maryland, and then a subsidy of Allied Irish Bank, pleaded guilty to fraud amounting to $691 million (£345 million).</p>
<p>I think  the bitcoin network, exchanges and blockchain are still better trading tools than bank internet solutions (with a very small budget compared to what the banks are paying for security). In a couple of years with similar budgets, crypto-currencies exchanges will be much safer. Even though it’s theoretically a better model, there’s a lot of room for improvement. We need to make alt coins exchanges better and devs around the world should collaborate to make out community better. One day we will feel safe keeping our altcoins in exchanges, just like we have money in our bank accounts. When it happens, bitcoin will be at $USD10,000.</p>
<p>Stay safe crypto traders.</p>

<p>Sooner than you think, everything is going to change thank to the technology of Bitcoin, everything! I didn&#8217;t get obsessed with cryptos only because I wanted to &#8220;get rich.&#8221; Ok, that helped a little &#8211; I also wanted a front row seat to the greatest change in civilization since the industrial revolution. That change is coming and the future is as clear as day to me.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t about a pet rock or a silly fad, it certainly has nothing to do with tulips or a mere bubble, this is about a total replacement for the old centralized systems. A technological revolution that is also a money trap, that eventually replaces what it traps. Driven by self interest initially, but with a design that actually helps everyone more in the end, because really, anything is better than what we have now and people know it.</p>
<p>This is not something that the media can easily program people away from. Even the tried and true fear and uncertainly will be useless over the long run, as their own greed will draw them in. Those that hated Bitcoin in the past, will love it! Politicians will love it, China will love it, even the President will love it! Anyone that wants to have any power in the future at all, will in time side with Bitcoin and cryptos.<br />
The only rational choice for them is to adapt, and adapt first, as there won&#8217;t be as much need for any centralization in the future. Trying to delay it will only undermine them more. Increasing the adoption rates like everything else that the government tries to prohibit. Join the party, or miss the party&#8230; Those are the only good choices. I would rather join it myself, and of course, have a front row seat for the festivities.</p>

															<h2><a href="../../../../2014/08/why-bitcoin-could-be-good-for-national-economies/index.html">Why Bitcoin could be good for National Economies</a></h2>
					
					<p class="post-meta"> by <a href="../../../../author/special-collaboration/index.html" title="Posts by Special Collaboration" rel="author">Special Collaboration</a> | Aug 11, 2014 | <a href="../../index.html" rel="category tag">Bitcoin 2.0 &amp; Metacoins</a> | </p><p><img class="alignright wp-image-675 size-medium" src="http://cryptomen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/fiatbitcoin-300x206.jpg" alt="Fiat vs Bitcoin" width="300" height="206" />There is a lot of talk about Bitcoin and crypto-currencies from a lot of different people. Many of them placard this technology as the new disruptive innovation that will allow humanity to escape centralized systems of control. Many of them discard it as a hype and soon-to-fail attempt to fool people into giving them their money. No point of view I have seen has really thought about or discussed how this technology can be used to subsidize national economies; not currencies, entire economies.</p>
<p>The United States Dollar is a national currency that is used as the primary currency in the United States. It is the currency used by both the general public, the US government, and many nations around the world. It is a fiat currency, meaning it is not backed by anything other than the word of the US Government that all debts will be paid. The government prints money at a somewhat constant inflation rate and taxes the people to return dollars back to the government’s central bank in order to curb the necessity to print more money faster. The value of the dollar drops with inflation when money is printed, which causes the people with the currency to have less buying power. This is proven by the 96% loss on the buying power of the dollar since 1913. Conversely, if the dollar underwent deflation, or the amount of dollars was limited to a specific ceiling, there would be more people with less dollars, the only form of money available to the general public. It would cause the nation&#8217;s economy to fail, which was predicted by Franklin D Roosevelt. Everyone would get poor before the the prices of things came down to match the deflation in monetary flow.</p>
<p>The solution to this economic conundrum is, as pointed out often by multiple Federal Reserve Chairmen, to continue inflation at a slow rate. With constant inflation, the dollars value is constantly, but slowly lost.</p>
<p>With the availability and use of open-source, self-regulating, crypto-currencies a new economic theory is being created. One that sends most older monetary theories on the way of the Dodo bird. Since the US Dollar is the currency that the United States government uses, the currency, and the amount of debt is based on the amount of dollars created.Allowing competitive currencies to exist within commerce and the general public in the United States would allow a larger, less damaging, national economy than an economy strapped to its government’s fiat currency would or could.</p>
<p>From the consumer standpoint, if the number of consumers using cryptocurrencies is greater than the number of consumers using fiat currency, then that would mean that in the sale of a car, or an airplane, only the taxes would have to be paid in dollars, which gives the consumer more dollars to spend, and more boats sold in crypto-currencies.</p>
<p>From the merchants viewpoint, it would allow for more boat sales. As our new currencies gain in value, consumers are able to make purchases of larger value items using crypto-currencies they mined or purchased at a much cheaper price or cost. A consumer who bought Bitcoin at $30 can buy $620 worth of value currently. No Dollars need to be used to exchange the Bitcoin for a $620 boat. The boat maker will have to take a % of the Bitcoin, sell it to pay for taxes. With the rest of that Bitcoin, he could pay his costs, employees, and take the rest as profit. He would then become a consumer using crypto-currencies and buy things he needs with his left-over Bitcoin or save it for a time when it is worth more in value, or convert it to a newer crypto-currency that is going to be more valuable in the future if there is a currently unidentified problem with Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Detaching the currency the public uses from the governments currency allows the government to be more flexible with it&#8217;s own currency. The government can spend more money, or deflate without destroying the national economy, because the people of the country won&#8217;t be constantly using, hoarding, and constantly inflating the dollar. The dollar would then be used for more government transactions and they would have a lot more dollars at the current value, because the general public is using crypto-currency to make transactions and only paying the taxes in dollars.</p>
